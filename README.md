# 3D Portfolio

See the site live [here](https://richard-fu1.github.io/3d_portfolio/)!

This is a project which comes from a Youtube tutorial I found from [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery), namely from [this video](https://youtu.be/FkowOdMjvYo?si=aZmsyDFD5xigHcO0), so special thanks to him!

This uses a combination of the following frameworks and technologies (more to be added as time goes on!):

- React
- Three.js
- Tailwind CSS
- (Bootstrapped using Vite)
